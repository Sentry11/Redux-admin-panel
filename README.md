## Education project
This test project was developed to improve my skills in react/redux development. At the beginning, I created the layout,then created a fake Api where all the data is stored.<br/> 
With the help of the concurrently library, both the application and the fake server are launched.<br/>
In the final form, the project uses the redux toolkit.<br/>
The application has the following functionality:
<li>Filtration
<li>Adding
<li>Changing
<li>Removing
<li>Creating
<br/><br/>You should also know that the filters also come from the server
in json format
