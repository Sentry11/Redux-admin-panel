This test project was developed to improve my skills in react/redux development. At the beginning, the layout was developed, then a fake Api was created where all the data is stored. With the help of the concurrently library, both the application itself and the fake server are launched. In the final form, the project uses the redux toolkit. Perhaps in the future it will be rewritten under RTK query.
